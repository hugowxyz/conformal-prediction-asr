 It's no doubt.
 Slow down!
 There's no guy on it.
 It's low down.
 It's no guy on it.
 It's no God.
 It's no god.
 It's no dialogue.
 It's no time.

 It's no going.
 Let's go, darling.
 There's no guy.
 It's no goal.

 It's low guy.
 There's no going.
 It's no problem.
 It's no girl.
 There's no guy on him.
 It's no guy on that.
 It's no guy on the road.
 It's slow down.
 There's no guy right now.
 Let's go, darling!
 It's no guy on.
 It's no guy right there.

 There's no guy right here.
 Let's go down.
